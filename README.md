This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using nested routes and parameters in React Router DOM v6. The problem occurs when a route with parameters is nested within other routes.  The solution involves careful consideration of route ordering and potential conflicts.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` offers a corrected implementation.
